# SA_LinePracticeUtil
An asi plugin for San Andreas that helps practice driving lines and such. Giving you the ability to save your heading and velocity on any vehicle, set and restore various in-game attributes, make and load quicksaves, and add permanently parked vehicles to said quicksaves.

Acknowledged bugs:
1. if you get in a vehicle, and get back out without setting a position, you are still able to teleport back into the vehicle by pressing x. I guess I could say this is intended, but I definitely did not intend this.
2. if you do the above, I believe you're made immune to falling off bikes. Either that, or your driving/bike skill gets set to infinity.

# How to use
1. Ensure the plugin is installed.
2. Load the game and enter a vehicle.
3. Press the tab key. You've now set a 'point'.
4. Press X. You've now teleported to the 'point' you've set.
5. There are more features as of 4.0 including quicksaves. Read the readme for details.

# Install
1. [Download](https://github.com/yuyumta/SA_LinePracticeUtil/releases/download/4.0/SA_practice_utility.zip) the asi file.
2. Install an asi loader if needed.
3. Extract the contents of the zip to the game's root directory...
4. Profit.
