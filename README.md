# SA_LinePracticeUtil
An asi plugin for San Andreas that helps practice driving lines.

LPU 2.0 is out. Despite the big version jump, the only 'features' added are bugfixes. Idk why it's 2.0 instead of 1.1, don't ask me.
Fixes include:
1. Bug with loading saves is fixed (some typo with m_nLastSpawnedTime).
2. Speed sometimes not being applied after loading a savepoint (this may still be broken, I haven't tested it enough lol)
3. Vehicle health is now saved instead of being set to an absurdly high value.

# How to use
1. Ensure the plugin is installed.
2. Load the game and enter a vehicle.
3. Press the tab key. You've now set a 'point'.
4. Press 1. You've now teleported to the 'point' you've set.
5. Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahcysfi0oMQ/

# Install
1. [Download](https://github.com/yuyumta/SA_LinePracticeUtil/releases/download/2.0/LinePracticeUtil.asi) the asi file.
2. Install an asi loader if needed.
3. Put the asi file in the plugins directory.
4. Profit.
