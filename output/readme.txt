SA Practice Utility version 4.996

Installation:
1. Make sure you have version 1.00 of GTA:SA installed. This plugin does not work with any of the subsequent versions of the game.
2. Install an asi loader. I recommend Silent's asi loader for this.
3. Place SAPU.asi and SAPU-config.ini into your GTA:SA root directory.

There are quite a few config options in "SAPU-config.ini", including keybinds. Please see if the presets are according to your liking. The keybinds use a numerical hex key code value to identify which key they should be assigned to. Please take a look at the websites linked to by the two websites listed at the top of the config file to find which key code would suit your needs.

Features:
1. Teleporting a vehicle to your chosen place, whilst saving velocity, heading, and a multitude of other parameters. 
By default, this is bound to tab (to set the place), and x (to teleport). This only works in vehicles, and not on foot.

2. Quicksaves and quickloads. By default, this is bound to F5 (load) and F6 (save). You may only save when not in a vehicle, 
and in addition, saving while on missions will almost certainly result in a corrupt save. Quicksaves have their own save file 
named "SAPU-quicksave.b" in the "GTA San Andreas User Files" directory. It's an ordinary save file, so you're free to rename 
it as one of the normal save files, and use it as such. You may also do the reverse of this, and rename a normal save file to 
"SAPU-quicksave.b", and it will be loaded, provided the save file isn't defective.

3. Persistent vehicle spawns. By default, this is bound to F7. Upon activation, the current vehicle you're in will be permanently 
marked as a parked car at the specific location you were in once you save the game. At the moment, this feature only works 
with quicksaves, so be sure not to save at a save marker if you intend to make use of this feature. You should also take care 
when creating persistent vehicles, as there is no way to undo a mistake. In addition to this, overlapping vehicles do not spawn 
inside of one another, instead, the one that was made before will be spawned, and the rest will remain hidden. This may also 
cause problems if you intend to spawn several vehicles close to one another, as the detection for whether a vehicle is too close 
is not dependent on collision, but rather, a small area.
